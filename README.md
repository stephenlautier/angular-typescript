# angular-typescript
Sample application using Angular 1.x with Typescript, Gulp and bower.

For fun I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as the code editor.

## Features
 - Gulp example
 - Bower as Package Manager
 - TypeScript Workflow
 - SASS Workflow
 - Sourcemaps for both SASS/TypeScript working
 - AngularJS with TypeScript inc.
  - UI Routing
  - Basic Navigation
  - All out TypeScript (not hybrid)
  - ngAnnotate (for auto-injection)
  - Logger
 
 
## Getting started
- From the project folder execute
```
npm install
```
- To run the app, execute the following command:
```
gulp watch
```
- Browse to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under src/app or assets/styles and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.

### Machine Setup
- Make sure you have NodeJS, Bower and git installed.
- Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
- Ensure that [Bower](http://bower.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:
```
npm install -g bower
```
